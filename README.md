The networks used in "Multi-level Feature Extraction and Reconstruction for 3D MRI Image Super-Resolution".

Due to the storage limitation of GitHub, we did not upload the super-resolution reconstructed images. If you are conducting similar research and wish to compare our method, please don't hesitate to contact us (jldu@cqu.edu.cn).

We have done some work on using different convolution operations to extract various image features for MRI image super-resolution reconstruction, and the foundation of this work comes from our previous conference paper:
